      <h1>P.A.C.E.</h1>
        <p>Mountain Empire PACE is a health care plan for frail seniors who live in Wise County, Lee County, Scott County or the City of Norton.  PACE stands for Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly.</p>
        <p>PACE is a nationally recognized model of long term care that allows frail older people to live in their own homes and communities as long as possible.  PACE offers a broad range of medical, social, and day health services in home-based and community-based settings and affords hospital or nursing home care when needed.</p>
      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>be 55 years of age or older</li>
          <li>live in Norton or in Lee, Scott or Wise Counties</li>
          <li>be certified as eligible for nursing home level of care by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and</li>
          <li>be able to live safely in the community with support services arranged by PACE.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>Services are usually provided in the PACE Center and in the participant’s home,   but when needed are also provided in a hospital,  nursing home, or rehabilitation center.  The PACE Center is located at 1508 Third Avenue East in Big Stone Gap.  Hours of Operation are 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM Monday through Friday.  Medical coverage is available seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day.</p>
      <p>The PACE  Interdisciplinary Team, composed of health care professionals with expertise in multiple areas, develops a plan of care to optimize each participant’s care to enable them to  safely live in their own home.  At home, participants can receive personal care, homemaker services, skilled nursing care, medicine, nutrition, and restorative therapies as needed.</p>
       <p>When participants need specialty medical care, PACE makes appointments, provides transportation, and coordinates care with the specialists.  The PACE physician admits and follows participants in the hospital and hursing home.</p>
       <h2>Enrollment Information</h2>
       <p>MEOC became a permanent provider of PACE services in March 2008 and immediately started enrolling participants.  We hope to reach a permanent enrollment level of 150 - 180 participants. </p>

        <h1>Adult Day Health Care</h1>
        <p>Mountain Empire Older Citizens is an Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC).  ADRCs serve as single points of entry into the long-term care system for older adults and people with disabilities and are sometimes referred to as "one stop shops" or "no wrong door" systems.  ADRCs address many of the frustrations people experience when trying to find needed information, services, and supports.  ADRCs provide information about the full range of options that are available, coordinate aging and disability services, provide objective information and assistance, empower people to make informed decisions about their long term supports, and serve as convenient entry points for all public and private long term care programs and support services.  MEOC works in partnership with the Junction Center for Independent Living and a host of partners in the area in this effort.</p>

      <h1>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</h1>
        <p>Official 2011 poverty rates provided by the University of Virginia's Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service are Lee County 27.6%, Scott County 18.7%, and Wise County 22.8%.  Despite high poverty rates, the SNAP benefit is under-utilized in MEOC's service area.  Older persons, in particular, seem unwilling to jump through SNAP application hoops in order to qualify for what they perceive to be a very low amount of assistance.  The SNAP Outreach Program is designed to find individuals who may be eligible and make the application process as easy as possible for them.  MEOC SNAP Outreach pre-screens individuals,  completes SNAP applications for those who appear to be eligible, delivers applications to local Departments of Social Services (DSS) and works with applicants to ensure that all supportung documentation is provided to the DSS eligibility worker.</p>
