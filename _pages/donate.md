		<br><br>There are many ways to support the community service efforts of Mountain Empire Older Citizens.&nbsp; Your contributions make a real difference.&nbsp; All donations/payments are applied directly to the program/service designated by you.&nbsp; If you are making a donation, MEOC is exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501 (C) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code, therefore your gift is tax-deductible to the full extent provided by law.&nbsp; MEOC is a nonprofit organization operating since 1974.&nbsp; Our federal tax identification number is 541025257.&nbsp; You should consult your financial planner or tax adviser to determine the exact tax advantages of any gift you are considering.&nbsp; We provide a receipt for all online donating that can be used to claim a tax deduction.&nbsp; If you need a copy of the receipt or need a receipt for your annual giving please call 1-800-252-6362.

<p align="justify">IMPORTANT NOTICE:&nbsp; Once you click on a program/service button, you will be directed to a Secure Payment Site.&nbsp; You are required to enter detailed donation/payment information.&nbsp; <b>If you are making a payment for services for an individual, you are required to list the individual's name and address information.</b>&nbsp; This ensures payments are posted correctly.</p>
