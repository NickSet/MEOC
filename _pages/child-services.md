      <h1>Children's Advocacy Center</h1>
		<p>The Southwest Virginia Children's Advocacy Center (CAC), an accredited CAC, is a child-friendly, child-focused, community oriented, safe facility where representatives from many disciplies meet to discuss and make decisions about the investigation, treatment and prosecution of child abuse cases.  The center is designed to accommodate children of all ages; helping to reduce stress and trauma for the child victim.</p>
        <p>The multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach brings together, under one umbrella, all the professionals and agencies needed to offer comprehensive services:  law enforcement, child protective services, prosecution, victim advocacy and the medical community.  A specially trained professional conducts forensic interviews with the child victim, while team members observe and participate from behind a one-way mirror.  This approach reduces the number of times children must repeat their stories of abuse.  The initial contact person and the safe atmosphere are critical in the efforts to gain children's confidence and trust.</p>
		<p>Mental health treatment services include short-term mental health therapy, crisis intervention, assessment, case management, safety planning, criminal justice and advocacy.  Because child abuse does not affect only the child, but the entire family, the CAC also offers the Family Advocate program.  This program provides case management, education and support to parents/caregivers to help them better understand the impact of child abuse.</p>
        <p>Healing can happen, children can learn coping skills that reduce stress and parents/caregivers can help by supporting their child/children.  Ignoring what has happened will not make the “hurt” go away.</p>

      <h1>Kin Care</h1>
		<h2>A Brookdale Foundation Funded Program</h2>
		<p>KinCare provides services, support and assistance specifically to grandparents and/or other relative caregivers who are acting as surrogate parents or who have custody of relative children. Services include care coordination, monthly support groups, events, back to school supplies, counseling/case management, legal assistance, parenting education and information, advocacy, and information and referral.  </p>
		<p>There is a growing need for KinCare service in our region as we are witnessing a huge increase in the number of children being raised by their grandparents or other relatives.   There are many reasons why children are not with their biological parents such as: substance abuse by the parent(s); abuse or neglect of the child; parent(s) incarceration; parent(s) mental illness; abandonment of the child; death of parent(s); divorce of parent(s); lack of parenting skills; inability to provide care for child; illness of parent(s).  Children in the KinCare Program may be in the caregiver's home for a variety of reasons, such as:  as part of the formal foster care system (applied to be a foster parent and child is placed by Department of Social Services); in the informal foster care (placed with a relative by parent(s) or Department of Social Services); legal custody of the child has been appointed to the caregiver; or the relative child has been adopted by the relative caregiver.  If children are not part of the formal foster care system their grandparents do not receive governmental financial support for their care nor any of the other services available to foster care families.</p>
	   <ul>
			<li>Fees: No Charge</li>
			<li>Eligibility: Must be full-time caregivers of relative children.  Relative child must live with caregiver and caregiver provides primary care of the child. </li>
			<li>Intake Procedure: Walk-ins and telephone referrals accepted.</li>
			<li>Service Area: Scott,Lee, and Wise Counties and the City of Norton</li>

      <h1>Kin Care</h1>
		<p>The MEOC Foster Grandparent Program places eligible senior citizens in schools and Head Start classrooms working one-on-one with children under the direction of the classroom teacher.  Foster Grandparents spend quality time with these students helping them with letters and numbers, reading, singing, mentoring and modeling proper behavior.</p>
		<p>Seniors with a love for children and willing to devote 15-40 hours per week are encouraged to call for information and an application.  The program currently has partnerships with dozens of educational programs in Wise, Lee, and Scott Counties and the City of Norton.</p>
		<p>Foster Grandparents must be at least 55 years of age with a limited income.  Foster Grandparents will receive a tax-free monthly stipend for their service, which does not affect Medicare/Medicaid or Social Security, or benefits such as food stamps, rental assistance or federal fuel assistance.  They receive earned annual leave time, holiday pay and transportation reimbursement, an annual physical exam and supplemental insurance while they are at their sites.  For additional information</p>
